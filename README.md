## Purpose

The purpose of this branch is to provide a version of the Smart Medibox project code that can be easily simulated using Wokwi. By configuring the code to work with Wokwi's simulation environment, developers can test the functionality of the Smart Medibox without the need for physical hardware.

## Usage

To simulate the Smart Medibox project in Wokwi:

1. Clone or download this branch of the repository.
2. Open the project in the Wokwi platform.
3. Run the simulation to test the functionality of the Smart Medibox code.
4. Debug and refine the code as needed directly within the Wokwi environment.

## Simulation Link

You can simulate this project on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/397074918136117249).

## Branch Structure

This branch contains the necessary modifications to the Smart Medibox code to ensure compatibility with Wokwi simulation. It may include changes such as adjustments to hardware configurations, simulation-specific code optimizations, or other modifications to ensure seamless simulation within the Wokwi platform.
